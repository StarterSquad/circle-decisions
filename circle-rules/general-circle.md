## Mandate
The general circle has the mandate to make decisions about topics that are not delegated to other circles, within the confines of the law. The directors of Squads (Dmitry and Iwein) have committed to executing any General Circle decisions without second guessing them outside the circle meetings.

## How to become a member of the general circle
Anyone that is active in Squads can apply to join the general circle. Any existing member can propose someone new to join. We will propose this in the general circle meeting, and upon consent add the new member to the list above.

_What does it mean to be 'active in Squads'?_
To be active means to have taken action and to intend to do so in the future. Members that currently generate revenue are considered active. If none of the existing members know how you're active, your application might be ignored.

## How to end the circle membership
There are several ways to end membership of one of the circle members:

1. Member requests termination of membership. This can be done by the member unilaterally, by removing themselves from the list above. This task may be delegated, but it must be clear that the initiative was coming from the member itself.
2. The member is removed from the circle by the other members. This can only happen through a unanimous decision by all the other members of the circle.
