## How to become a member of the general circle
Anyone that is active in Squads can apply to join the general circle. We will propose this in the general circle meeting, and upon consent add the new member to the list above.

_What does it mean to be 'active in Squads'?_
To be active means to have taken action and to intend to do so in the future. Sending messages in our chatgroups, writing posts for social media, committing to a client project are all relevant activities that make one an 'active' member.

## How to end the circle membership
There are several ways to end membership of one of the circle members:

1. Member requests termination of membership. This can be done by the member unilaterally, by removing themselves from the list above. This task may be delegated, but it must be clear that the initiative was coming from the member itself.
2. The member is removed from the circle by the other members. This can only happen through a unanimous decision by all the other members of the circle.
