# Record Squads community decisions

To drive the governance of the Squads community we want to record agreements and their review process.

Those agreements are initiated by a community member (the maintainer) in form of a Proposal, and all other members can contribute to it.

The Proposal will be up for debate until no objections are raised and a final agreement is reached.


## Proposal creation and update

Every new Proposal or change to an existing Proposal it will be a PR submitted to this GitHub repository. Proposal PR accepts comments and contributions.

If a Proposal PR gets agreed will be merged to main. If instead we don't reach an agreement the PR will be declined and closed without being merged.
