# Goal
To make sure we have a clear definition on the responsibilities of circles and their members, including who the members are, how one can join the circle, and how one leaves.

## Establish rules for joining, leaving, and circle membership
- maintainer: Iwein
- driver: currently anyone on the planet can join any Squads circle, and it's not clear how they would leave, this seems too vague
- budget: n.a.
- actions
  - publish the rules and definitions, and encourage the entire community to influence them
- term
  - start date 2022-12-01
  - effective until explicitly revoked

Definitions:
**Circle**: a group of individuals, uniting themselves to achieve a common goal
Circle **Member**: an individual that is part of a circle
Mandate: rights and responsibilities given from one individual or circle, to another individual or circle

General rules that SHOULD apply to all circles:
0. Any individual MAY create a new circle and invite others to join
1. Any individual MUST NOT be forced to take any action without their consent
2. A circle MAY set circle rules for itself with consent of its members
3. An individual SHOULD become a circle member of a specific cirle if:
    - that circle consents, AND
    - the individual consents.
4. Each circle MUST publish their custom rules in this git repository
5. A circle's rules MUST NOT be changed by others than its members
