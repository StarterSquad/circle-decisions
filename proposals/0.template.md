# Goal
To drive the governance of the Squads community we want to record agreements and their review process.

Those agreements are initiated by a community member (the maintainer) in form of a Proposal, and all other members can contribue to it.

The Proposal will be up for debate until no objections are raised and a final agreement is reached. 

## Proposal template
- driver (motive for the proposal, see https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/driver.html)
- maintainer (the person with this role (https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/role.html), keeps track of the proposal and decision)
- goal (what we want to achieve with it)
- budget (optional)
- actions
  - no executors need to be defined when creating a proposal
  - once agreement is reached, actions must be recorded
- term
  - how long this is going to be in effect for (e.g from 2025-01 to 2025-04)
  - when the end of the term is reached, the maintainer plans a review with the circle about it
- milestones
  - moments during the term to check on the actions
  - maintainer checks on the milestones, and reports the milestone outcomes during the circle meetings
