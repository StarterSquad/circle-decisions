# Goal
To drive the governance of the Squads community we want to record agreements and their review process.

Those agreements are initiated by a community member (the driver) in form of a Proposal, and all other members can contribue to it.

The Proposal will be up for debate until no objections are raised and a final agreement is reached. 

## Proposal template
- driver
- goal
- budget if needed (no need for this proposal)
- actions
  - no executors need to be defined when creating a proposal
  - once agreement is reached, actions must be recorded
- term
  - how long this is going to be in effect for (e.g 6months)
  - when term is reached, we must have a review meeting about it, organized by the driver
- milestones
  - moments during the term to check on the actions
  - driver checks on the milestones, and report back during the circle meetings the milestone outcomes
